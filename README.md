# Readazzler2
[What started life as a Google Reader replacement] (https://github.com/msummers/Readazzler) has changed overtime.

1. Use Neo4j as feeds are graphy
2. Find not so apparent relationships in the data
3. All-in-one Spring Boot app with embedded everything

The initial target is Tumblr feeds. Aside from the obvious Tumblr has highly linked and highly entertwined data that is a good experimental fit.
